## [VILNC Dataset]()

The Varied Indoor Luminance & Nightscapes Collection (VILNC Dataset) is a meticulously curated assembly of 500 real-world low-light images, captured with the precision of a Canon EOS 550D camera. This dataset is segmented into two main environments, comprising 460 indoor scenes and 40 outdoor landscapes. Within the indoor category, each scene is represented through a trio of images, each depicting a distinct level of dim luminance, alongside a corresponding reference image captured under normal lighting conditions. For the outdoor scenes, the dataset includes low-light photographs, each paired with its respective normal light reference image, providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing and enhancing low-light imaging techniques.
